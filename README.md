# Home Assistant integratione for Tado Auto-Assist
### Introduction
This integration allows you to use Tado's API to create your own "Auto-Assist". You can monitor the operating mode (Home or Away) and whether or not there are open windows in your home. Then the integration can automatically change the operating status based on the geolocation of mobile devices and/or disable thermostats when open windows are detected in certain areas of the house. The integration is also able to provide the number of mobile devices in the home and the name of the areas where open windows were detected (only if automatic thermostat suspension is not enabled).
