## 🚀 Introduction
This integration for **Home Assistant** allows you to use **Tado**'s API to create your own "Auto-Assist." It periodically communicates with Tado's servers to retrieve the home's status and can modify it based on user input.
The integration relies on the PyTado library, which is automatically installed alongside it.

## ✨ Features
- **Automation**: Automates the change of operating mode (Home or Away) and the suspension of home heating.
- **Mobile Device Tracking**: Detect mobile devices linked to Tado and their home presence.
- **Home & Away Modes**: Get your home to "Away" or "Home" mode with ease.
- **Open Window Detection**: Get alerts when a window is detected as open.
- **Customizable Scan Interval**: Choose how frequently the system checks for updates.
- **HA repair**: Support repair function in case of re-authentication.
- **Data Logging & Debugging**: Includes logging support for easy debugging.
